NITROGEN

WEBPAGE: http://projects.l3ib.org/nitrogen/

REQUIREMENTS:
    GTKMM 2.10
    GTK 2.10

BUILDING:

    ./bootstrap
    ./configure
    make
    make install (as root or a user with proper permissions)

    The binary is called, amazingly enough, "nitrogen".

    NOTE: If the "CXXFLAGS" env var is not set at ./configure time, autotools
          will gladly insert "-g -O2" in them. "-g" will inflate the size of 
          the nitrogen binary to nearly 2mb, so consider using:
          CXXFLAGS="-O2" ./configure
    
          PACKAGERS: Make sure you set CXXFLAGS to an appropriate value for
          the target system.

USAGE:
    See the man page. It *might* be up to date.
